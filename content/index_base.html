    <b>You are a crucial source of data needed to train and test AI.</b> If you
    support using AI in a certain way, you may want your data contributions to
    flow the systems that match your values. If you dislike how an organization
    is using AI, you may want to stop your data flow.

    Data levers allow us to reconfigure how the records we generate flow to AI
    systems. This page links to tools -- software you can download, browser
    extensions you can install, and online platforms you can visit -- that help
    "pull" data levers.
